Destroying infrastructure when no longer needed
===============================================

Automated
---------

gcluster destroy aiden05132-af3-slurm

Advanced / Manual
-----------------
Infrastructure should be destroyed in reverse order of creation:

terraform -chdir=aiden05132-af3-slurm/cluster destroy
terraform -chdir=aiden05132-af3-slurm/jupyter_notebook destroy
terraform -chdir=aiden05132-af3-slurm/build-image-base destroy
terraform -chdir=aiden05132-af3-slurm/environment destroy
